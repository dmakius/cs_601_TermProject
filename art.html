                    <p>
                            I only started two years ago when the pandemic 
                            lockdowns started. I currently only paint with acrylics 
                            but would like to branch out to watercolors and oil paints. 
                            I usually sketch an image before I paint it. As of now only my
                            paintings are here and I plan on adding
                            my sketches in the near future.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                            I tend to paint a combination of following tutorials on youtube
                            and whatever is in my head. I enjoy painting landscapes that capture
                            the life and action in a moment. I dont enjoy painting
                            portraits as I find them boring. Regardless of what I paint,
                            the most important thing is the colors that I use. I always perfer 
                            bright colors over darker colors. The world is a hard place so if I am
                            going to paint it I might as well make it collorfull.
